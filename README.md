# **Bing News Search — An End-to-End Azure Data Engineering Project in Microsoft Fabric**

## **🌟 Overview**

Utilizing the Bing News API within Azure, the project builds a comprehensive end-to-end Data Engineering solution using Microsoft Fabric. The goal is to analyze the latest news, determine the sentiment of each news item, and create interactive dashboards that effectively visualize the insights.

To break it down, this project involves six key steps:

1.	Create a Bing Search Resource in Azure
2.	Data Ingestion
3.	Data Transformation with Incremental Loading
4.	Sentiment Analysis with Incremental Loading
5.	Data Visualization and Reporting in Power BI
6.	Set up Alerts with Data Activator with notifications on Teams/Email

## **🚀 Data Source**
Bing latest news data was loaded from Bing Search Resource News Search APIs v7 [Data](https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0/news/search) available in Azure.

## **🛠 Installation & Usage**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally or in the cloud.

**Prerequisites**

* Azure Subscription with access to Fabric services.
* Bing News Search API Key (F1 Free Tier recommended for testing).
* Basic understanding of Python, SQL, and Spark.

**Quick Start**

1. Clone the repository
  
2. Set up Azure resources:
   * Create a Resource Group in Azure.
   * Deploy Bing Search v7 API in Azure Marketplace.
   * Set up OneLake storage.
3. Configure Spark Notebooks & ADF Pipelines:
   * Import provided Spark Notebooks into Synapse.
   * Set up ADF Pipelines for automated ingestion.
4. Run Sentiment Analysis:
   * Configure Azure Cognitive Services API.
   * Execute sentiment classification on ingested news.
5. Visualize in Power BI:
   * Connect Power BI to OneLake.
   * Build interactive reports and dashboards.
6. Enable Data Activator for real-time alerts.

## **📈 KPI Metrics**

For the visualization, the following KPIs are measured:
* Total published news (positive, negative, neutral, and mixed).
* Percentage of each sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, and mixed).
